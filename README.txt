Requierements:
	- Probably Java 11 and higher won't work need to use Java10
Libraries:
	- No external libraries have been used. 
	- JavaFX has been used for graphics.
Keybindings:
	- You can just click to the points in the screen and create vertices.But you need to recisely click to the integers in the plane. (Like 1,1 or 3,4 )
	- Pressing C will create a little textfield which will take number of vertices as input. You can enter how many vertices of input yo want to have here. 
	- Pressing R afterwards will remove the textfield as well as the button.
	- Pressing B will  build the polgon ( Warning I use vertices with smallest x and largest x, please make sure there are any vertices between these two, both in their half plane under and above ).
	- Pressing K will construct kernel. (The area with blue is the kernel area and the Lines with blueviolet color are the rays going out from the polygon )
Note: Sometimes kernel will spawn without some edges missing or some edges additional.
